		<h1 class="headtext2"> Passive: Elapsed Daytime (Blink)(Damage) </h1>
		<p class="bodytext">When holding down the Basic Attack button, Benedetta enters the Swordout state and keeps gathering the Sword Intent. If releasing the Basic Attack button after the Sword Intent is fully charged, Benedetta will use Swordout Slash in the direction she's facing and dash forward, dealing (+200% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage (identified as Skill Damage and decays to 50% on minions and creeps) to enemies on the path.
			Only when Benedetta is in Swordout state and her Sword Intent is fully charged by holding down the Basic Attack button, she can release the Swordout Slash.
			Benedetta can also gain Sword Intent when dealing damage via Basic Attack and Skills.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="bodytext">NOTES:</p>
		<p class="bodytext">Holding down the Basic Attack button is considered as casting a skill.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">While Benedetta is in the Swordout state, she approximately gains 66.667 points of Sword Intent per second, and becomes full at 100 on 1.5 seconds of activation. She can overcharge the skill for another 1.5 seconds.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">When Benedetta deals damage with skill or basic attacks, she receives 30 points of Sword Intent.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">Benedetta will gradually lose 10 Sword Intent every second if she is unable to replenish it.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2"> First Skill: Phantom Slash (AoE)(Blink)(Physical Skill) </h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Benedetta withdraws swiftly and leaves a shadow in front. After a short delay, her shadow slashes forward in a fan-shaped area, dealing 200-400 (+60% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage and slowing the enemies by 60% for 0.5 seconds.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">Meanwhile, Benedetta dashes forward to slash, dealing 50-150 (+70% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage. (If the target is hit by her shadow, damage caused by Benedetta herself will increase to 200%.)</p>
		<p class="bodytext">The skill's stats scale per level (base to max); cooldown from 9-7 seconds, mana cost from 55-85, shadow damage from 200-400, and slash damage from 50-150.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2"> Second Skill: An Eye for An Eye (Blink)(Buff(Physical Skill) </h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Benedetta raises her weapon to defend, gaining control immunity and blocking damage from any source for 0.8 seconds. After this, she stabs in the designated direction, dealing 300 (+80% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">If Benedetta successfully fends off any damage while defending, she will gain full Sword Intent. If she fends off any control effects, her subsequent stab stuns the target for 1.5 seconds. This skill has a (scales per level) cooldown of 15-10 seconds, mana cost of 100-125, and a base damage of 300-450.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2"> Ultimate Skill: Alecto: Final Blow (Burst)(Blink)(Physical Skill) </h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Benedetta clenches Alecto and slashes forward after a short delay (invincible while dashing), slowing all targets on the path by 70% for 1 second.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">After dashing, Benedetta detonates the Sword Intent on the path, strangling the enemy with the Sword Intent for 2.5 seconds, dealing 120-160 (+85% Extra Physical Attack) Physical Damage and slowing the enemy by 20% every 0.2 seconds. The skill has (scales per level) a cooldown of 45-3 seconds, mana cost of 110-160, and a base damage of 120-160.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2" style="clear:left"> Hero Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Benedetta is a very good early game hero because of her high base damage. She's very agile and slippery because of her skills. Her passive makes her dash every 1.5 seconds, making her also a very fast roamer. She is not only good in jungling but also in lanes because of how fast she can clear minions. She has an aggresive type of playstyle though so it wouldn't be optimal for her to play passively.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">However, she is very dependent on the use of her skills, which makes her mana consumption high. Her basic attack damage is quite low and is hard to use in late-game, where her burst skills now can't kill enemies easily. Her skills also have a short delay before casting. This split second pause gives the enemy the time to react, especially if they have faster skill casting than her. She's one of the hardest heroes to use because of the complicated basic attack mechanics.  </p>
		<h1 class="headtext2"> Reasons in choosing this Hero</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Since her release, her performance has been really good. Her high burst damage can catch enemies off guard, which really helps since it fits my role as an assassin player. I've been using her quite a lot whenever I had the chance and my high winrate on her proves her dominance.  </p>
