			<h1 class="headtext2"> Passive: Cloud Walker (Buff)</h1>
			<p class="bodytext">Ling's superb Lightness Skill helps him leap among walls and assassinate enemies. When resting on the wall, Ling restores extra 4 Lightness Points per second. Each time Ling deals damage to enemies, he restores extra 5 Lightness Points.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">Ling’s Lightness Skill grants him 15% Critical Chance, but decreases his Critical Damage to 140%.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2"> First Skill: Finch Poise (Blink)(Buff)</h1>
			<p class="bodytext">Passive: Ling’s Critical Chance is permanently increased by 5%-17.5%.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">Active: Ling casts his Lightness Skill, leaping onto the designated wall, entering half-stealth state, restoring Lightness Points more quickly and gaining 30% Movement Speed. If Ling receives damage, he will leave the half-stealth state. If he is controlled, he will fall onto the ground and be slowed by 30% for 2 seconds. When using this skill to jump from a wall to another, it will reset the Cooldown and refresh the half-stealth state. This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds after going back to the ground and has a 35 energy cost.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">Ling charges in a designated direction and stabs the nearby enemies at his destination, dealing 230-305 (+40% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="../images/ling2nd2.png" alt="ling2ndwall" class="heroskills">
		</figure>
			<p class="bodytext">If Ling casts this skill when he is on the wall, he will dash to a designated spot on the ground, dealing 230-305 (+40% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage to enemies within a small area and slowing them down by 30% for 1.5 seconds. If this attack deals crit damage, enemies within the area will extra be slowed by 45% for 0.75 seconds.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">This skill can trigger ATK Effects as Basic Attack and can restore 35-60 HP (scales per level) for Ling each time hits an enemy. It has a cooldown of 2.5 seconds and a 49 energy cost. It has a base damage of (scales per level) 230-305.</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2"> Ultimate Skill: Tempest of Blades (Burst/CC)(Physical Skill)</h1>
			<p class="bodytext">Ling leaps up in the air and casts his superb sword skill for 1.5 seconds, during which he becomes invincible, gains 10% Movement Speed, and is able to move. Then he lands on the ground, dealing 250-450 (+100% Total Physical Attack) Physical Damage to enemies within the area of effect, knocking enemies in the central area airborne for 1 second, and generating a Sword Field that lasts for 8 seconds.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">At the edge of the Sword Field, there will be 4 field eyes named "Tempest of Blades". By touching the field eye, Ling can reset the Cooldown of "Defiant Sword" and restore 25 Lightness Points. This skill has a cooldown of (seconds) 52 / 49 / 46 (scales per level). It deals a base damage of 250-450 (scales per level).</p>

		<h1 class="headtext2" style="clear:left"> Hero Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Ling has one of the fastest roaming capabilities among all the heroes because of his ability to jump between walls. He can be hard to predict as he can gank from any direction. His farming speed is also good and can easily kill squishy heroes, especially in mid to late-game. </p>
		<p class="bodytext">However, just like <a href="../htdocs/FANNY.html" class="intextlink">Fanny</a>, he's reliant on the blue buff (an advantageous buff that can be acquired by killing a certain jungle creep). Because most of his skills are dash/blink skills, he can be countered by heroes with knockbacks and stuns if not used optimally. There are also times that he can't benefit much from friendly buffs given by other heroes' skills, especially if they're a little far from the wall he's on.</p>
		<h1 class="headtext2"> Reasons in choosing this Hero</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">His fast movements caught my attention, and made him one of my favorite heroes to use. His ability to roam around really helps in ganking the lanes of my teammates and invading the enemy jungle. He can also go in and out of teamfights easily, making him really hard to hunt. Even though he's easy to kill because of his low defense, he can still evade the enemies' skills. He's still one of my top picks no matter the meta. </p>
