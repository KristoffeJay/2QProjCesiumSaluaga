		<h1 class="headtext2" style="clear:left"> Hero Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">Fanny is one of the most mobile and fast heroes in the game. Because of her 2nd skill, she can be too slippery and can also deal high damage in early and midgame because of her speed in farming and in killing heroes.</p>
		<p class="bodytext">However, she has disadvantages, especially in late game. Just like <a href="../htdocs/LING.html" class="intextlink">Ling</a>, she’s dependent on the blue buff (an advantageous buff that can be acquired by killing a certain jungle creep) because of how high her energy usage is. She’s reliant on the walls to use her cables (2nd skill). Fanny is one of the most difficult heroes to use in the game and requires high skills, good control, and fast hands to use effectively. She also has a lot of counter heroes that could stop her by using their CC/Displacement/Interrupt skills such as stuns and knockbacks.</p>
		<h1 class="headtext2"> Reasons in choosing this Hero</h1>
		<p class="bodytext">This hero is one of my favorites as she helped me climb up the ranks during her peak form when she was one of the meta heroes. She could easily kill squishy heroes and is super fun to use because of her speed and agility. She could go in and out of the turrets easily and is very good when diving and ganking. Even though she went through a lot of nerfs and it’s getting super hard to use her these days, she’s still one of my top picks.</p>
